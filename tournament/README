This project uses Python modules and a PostgreSQL database to keep track of players 
and matches for a Swiss style game tournament.

The project contains the following 3 files:
   tournament_test.py
   tournament.py
   tournament.sql

The .sql file contains the necessary PostgreSQL statements to setup the database.
The test file tests the functionality of the modules in tournament.py.
